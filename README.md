# iOS_Simulator_Sa-Fuzz-i
A terrible iOS Simulator Safari fuzzer. It works as far as I know.<br>
# How to use:
<br>
./startFuzzing.sh /Users/<UserName>/Python/iOS-Simufuzz Example_PDF.pdf
<br><br>
<b>./startFuzzing.sh "location" "your fuzzing file (name.extension only : The file must be in the same path as the location"</b><br><br>
NOTE: startFuzzing.sh takes <b>2</b> arguments. The location of the working space "Where the scripts are" and the file you want to use "in the same directory". The reason it is this way is for some stupid reasons. I'll fix it soon.
